How to play
As of January 2015, play is in an alpha state. You get a single pokemon with four randomly selected moves, and you start in a battle against another pokemon with four random moves. Click on moves until the opponent dies until you do. Oppenent trainers may have several pokemon, so you will have to battle them all. Once you or the opponent trainer wins, the game loops, and you start from the beginning with the same creature and a bit more experience. If you die, your creature is restored to full for the next fight.
